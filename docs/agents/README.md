## Agent Docs Index

Chronological, numbered handovers for downstream agents (fresh-context safe). Use the naming format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-AGENT-###-short-topic.md`

Examples:
- `2025-08-10-AGENT-001-limit-order-extension-length.md`

Guidelines:
- Keep each handover self-contained: problem, root cause, changes, verification, acceptance criteria, rollback.
- Include exact file paths and what changed (resolver vs contracts vs infra).
- Include next-step troubleshooting selectors and decoding tips.
