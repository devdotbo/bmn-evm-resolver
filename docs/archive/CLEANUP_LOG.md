# Cleanup Log

## Date: 2025-01-07

### Files Removed

The following files were removed as they are old/unused implementations that have been superseded by newer, more focused implementations:

#### 1. `src/resolver/demo-resolver.ts`
- **Reason**: Old demo implementation replaced by the main `resolver.ts`
- **Description**: Early prototype resolver that directly handled simplified orders from Alice
- **Replacement**: Functionality consolidated into `src/resolver/resolver.ts` with proper indexer integration

#### 2. `src/resolver/base-resolver.ts`
- **Reason**: Abstract base class no longer needed with simplified architecture
- **Description**: Over-engineered base class with factory security monitoring
- **Replacement**: Direct implementation in `src/resolver/resolver.ts` is cleaner and more maintainable

#### 3. `src/resolver/simple-resolver.ts`
- **Reason**: Intermediate implementation superseded by final resolver
- **Description**: Bridge implementation between demo and final versions
- **Replacement**: `src/resolver/resolver.ts` provides complete functionality with better indexer integration

#### 4. `src/alice/simple-alice.ts`
- **Reason**: Replaced by specialized Alice implementations
- **Description**: Basic Alice implementation for testing
- **Replacement**: Split into:
  - `src/alice/limit-order-alice.ts` - For limit order integration
  - `src/alice/mainnet-alice.ts` - For mainnet operations

### Architecture Improvements

The cleanup simplifies the codebase by:
1. **Removing redundant abstractions** - Base classes and intermediate implementations
2. **Consolidating functionality** - Single resolver implementation instead of multiple variants
3. **Clear separation of concerns** - Distinct Alice implementations for different use cases
4. **Better maintainability** - Less code duplication and clearer file purposes

### Remaining Structure

```

### Testing

Created `test-indexer-query.ts` to verify:
- Resolver can connect to indexer
- SQL over HTTP queries work correctly
- Live subscriptions function (when supported)
- Error handling is robust

### Git Commands Used

```bash
git rm src/resolver/demo-resolver.ts
git rm src/resolver/base-resolver.ts
git rm src/resolver/simple-resolver.ts
git rm src/alice/simple-alice.ts
```

### Import Updates

The following files were updated to use the new unified resolver:
- `resolver.ts` - Updated to import `UnifiedResolver` from `src/resolver/resolver.ts`
- `test-manual-order.ts` - Updated to use `UnifiedResolver` instead of `SimpleResolver`
- `scripts/migration-checklist.ts` - Updated to check for `UnifiedResolver` instead of removed base classes

### Tests Completed

✅ `test-indexer-query.ts` - Successfully verified:
- Resolver can connect to indexer
- SQL over HTTP queries work correctly
- Live subscriptions function when supported
- Error handling is robust

### Next Steps

1. ✅ All imports have been updated
2. ✅ Tests verified - indexer connectivity working
3. Ready to commit the cleanup changes
