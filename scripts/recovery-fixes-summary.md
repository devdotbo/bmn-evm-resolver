# Recovery Script Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JQ Parsing Error**: The original script tried to parse orders as objects, but alice-state.json stores orders as tuples `[orderId, orderObject]`. Fixed by accessing the second element with `.[1]`.

2. **Block Range**: Increased the block range from 1000 to 10000 blocks to ensure we don't miss any escrow events.

3. **Better Formatting**: Enhanced the order display to show:
   - Human-readable chain names (Base, Etherlink, etc.)
   - BMN amounts in decimal format
   - Clear escrow status

4. **Added Token Information**:
   - Raw balance values for debugging
   - Token decimals verification
   - Allowance checking to understand approved amounts

5. **Destination Escrow Handling**: Added proper parsing and state checking for destination escrows on Etherlink.

6. **Summary Calculation**: Added total pending order calculation for Base chain.

## Current State

The recovery script now shows:
- Alice has 1,999,940 BMN on Base (60 BMN less than 2M)
- Alice has 2,000,000 BMN on Etherlink (full amount)
- There's a 10 BMN allowance to the EscrowFactory on Base
- No escrows were created for any of the orders
- Three pending orders exist in alice-state.json:
  - 100 BMN on Local Chain A (test)
  - 100 BMN on Base
  - 10 BMN on Base (the one mentioned in context)

## Recovery Status

Since no escrows were created, the 10 BMN order on Base was never processed by Bob. The tokens remain in Alice's wallet, and she only needs to:
1. Cancel the token approval if she doesn't want to create new orders
2. Or create a new order if she still wants to swap

The 60 BMN difference in the balance (1,999,940 instead of 2,000,000) suggests there might have been other transactions or the initial balance wasn't exactly 2M.
