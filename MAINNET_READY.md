export RESOLVER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."  # Your resolver private key
export ANKR_API_KEY="your_key"       # Ankr API key for RPC
export INDEXER_URL="http://localhost:42069"  # Ponder indexer URL

# 2. Run the resolver
deno task resolver

### 🚨 MAINNET BLOCKERS

Before mainnet deployment, these issues MUST be resolved:

1. **Contract Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy SimplifiedEscrowFactory v2.2.0 to Base mainnet
   - [ ] Deploy SimplifiedEscrowFactory v2.2.0 to Optimism mainnet
   - [ ] Verify contracts on Etherscan/Basescan

2. **Resolver Whitelisting**
   - [ ] Get resolver address whitelisted on Base mainnet factory
   - [ ] Get resolver address whitelisted on Optimism mainnet factory
   - [ ] Verify whitelist status with admin

3. **Production Testing**
   - [ ] Complete end-to-end test on Base testnet
   - [ ] Complete end-to-end test on Optimism testnet
   - [ ] Test with real 1inch limit orders (not just local)
   - [ ] Stress test with multiple concurrent orders

4. **Infrastructure Hardening**
   - [ ] Fix Ponder indexer event monitoring gaps
   - [ ] Implement reliable auto-withdrawal system
   - [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

5. **Security Audit**
   - [ ] Audit v2.2.0 contract changes
   - [ ] Review PostInteraction implementation
   - [ ] Verify no new attack vectors introduced

### 📈 Monitoring

- **Indexer Health**: `curl http://localhost:42069/health`
- **Resolver Logs**: Check for "✅ Found X pending swaps"
- **Secret Manager Stats**: Monitor pending/confirmed/failed secrets
- **On-chain Events**: Track OrderFilled and EscrowCreated events

### 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Private Key Management**
   - Use environment variables only
   - Never commit keys to git
   - Run security scan before commits: `./scripts/security-check.sh`

2. **Whitelist Status**
   - Resolver must remain whitelisted
   - Monitor for factory pause events
   - Check whitelist status regularly

3. **Profit Settings**
   - Currently set to 0% for testing
   - Increase MIN_PROFIT_BPS for production
   - Consider gas costs in profitability

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| "Resolver not whitelisted"     | Contact admin to whitelist resolver address |
| "No pending swaps"             | Check if indexer is running and synced      |
| "Failed to connect to indexer" | Verify INDEXER_URL and network connectivity |
| "Insufficient funds"           | Ensure resolver has tokens and ETH for gas  |
| "Secret already revealed"      | Normal - another party revealed first       |

### 📞 Support Channels

- **Technical Issues**: Check ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Contract Issues**: Verify addresses match this document
- **Indexer Issues**: Check Ponder logs at indexer URL
- **Security Issues**: Run `./scripts/security-check.sh`

### ✅ Testnet Verification

Run these commands to verify testnet setup:

```bash
# 1. Test PostInteraction implementation
deno run --allow-all test-postinteraction.ts

# 2. Verify factory v2.2.0 deployment
deno run --allow-all scripts/verify-factory-migration.ts

# 3. Test limit order creation with PostInteraction
deno run --allow-all alice.ts --action create

# 4. Check resolver whitelist status
deno run --allow-all scripts/check-whitelist.ts
```

## ⚠️ System Status: TESTNET ONLY

**PostInteraction is FIXED** in v2.2.0 and working correctly on testnet. The
system successfully:

- Creates limit orders with proper PostInteraction extension
- Triggers factory callbacks after order fills
- Creates cross-chain escrows automatically
- Completes atomic swaps end-to-end

**However, the system is NOT ready for mainnet** because:

- v2.2.0 contracts are not deployed to mainnet
- Resolver is not whitelisted on mainnet
- Production testing is incomplete
- Infrastructure needs hardening

### 📅 Estimated Timeline to Mainnet

1. **Week 1**: Deploy and verify v2.2.0 contracts on mainnets
2. **Week 2**: Complete production testing on testnets
3. **Week 3**: Security audit and infrastructure hardening
4. **Week 4**: Mainnet deployment and monitoring setup
